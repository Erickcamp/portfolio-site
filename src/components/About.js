        Hello world! I am Eric Camp! I am a very dedicated developer who enjoys the tasks of solving
        problems and building any idea out there. I love the feeling of being stumped and after hard
        work, finding the solution. Nothing is impossible! I love the idea of continuing to learn
        and the vast amount of possibilities there are within the development world. I am a proud
        father of three, a lucky Romeo to my Juliet since high school, and a video game enthusiast!
